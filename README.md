# Legal_Seach_Engine-ElasticSearch_TFIDF_BM25
In this project, I have implemented a legal precedent search engine using elastic search checking similarity based on TF-IDF and BM25. The pre-processed verbose query is checked against a corpus of legal precedents and user is provided with most relevant judgements to the query.
